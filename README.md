endian-cpp
==========
From [This provides the endian conversion functions form endian.h on Windows, Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, and QNX. You still need to use -std=gnu99 instead of -std=c99 for gcc. The functions might actually be macros. Functions: htobe16, htole16, be16toh, le16toh, htobe32, htole32, be32toh, le32toh, htobe64, htole64, be64toh, le64toh. License: I hereby put "portable_endian.h" into the public domain. It would be nice to let me know if you use it, though. :)](https://gist.github.com/panzi/6856583)
